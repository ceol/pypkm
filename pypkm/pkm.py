"""PyPKM: Easy PKM file manipulation.

This utility serves as a friendly way to create, edit, encrypt, decrypt, and
convert PKM files. Its goal is to faciliate the creation of more end-user
tools and allow developers to work with PKM files.

Example usage:
    >>> from pypkm.pkm import Pkm
    >>> pkm = Pkm.load_from_path('gengar.pkm', generation=5)
    >>> pkm.moves
    [95, 138, 506, 171]
    >>> pkm.level = 100
    >>> pkm.save()
    gengar_new.pkm
    >>> pkm.level = 50
    >>> pkm.save('gengar_50.pkm')
    gengar_50.pkm

For instructions on how to set a specific attribute, refer to that
attribute's function in the Pkm class.

The encryption and decryption functions (including checksum and shuffle) are
taken from the pycrypto/crypto module created by Stephen Anthony Uy
<tsanth@iname.com>. Somehow, somewhere I came across this module, and it's
been an extremely valuable tool for encrypting and decrypting PKM files to
send over the GTS.

Knowledge of the PKM file structure comes from the awesome people at
ProjectPokemon <http://projectpokemon.org/>, both on the forums and in their
IRC channel.

    These functions are more specific to PKM files but will be— for the most
    part— abstracted out in the Pkm class. Because of this, they should not
    be called directly, so I've prefaced each with an underscore to signify
    that.
    
    The plan for file manipulation is to unpack the part that needs to be
    edited, insert the new value, and pack the file back up each time. Since
    the files are extremely small, the overhead should not be much greater
    than unpacking the entire file, doing all the editing, and then packing
    it back up once finished. This also allows the user to edit files without
    loading them beforehand.
